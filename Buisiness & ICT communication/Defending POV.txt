We will be talking about whether or not teens have usefull computer skills. I believe that they do have usefull computer skills. But mostly older people believe they don't,
I myself am a teen aswell and think I have some usefull computer skills myself. So I believe that this is an easy question for me then. Teens have been using computers
their whole life, so they have learned alot, most of the time even more than older people.

1) Everyday computer tasks: now that almost everything has been digitilized, most older people can't keep up. If you take a look at my parents or grand-parents for example.
They ask me to do alot of simple tasks on the computer (Printing, adding a document to an email, ... ).

2) Future: I already said that most of the things are digitilized, but not everything is. Teens are the ones that have to inovate, and because they use computers so much,
and learn how to program and stuff, they are the ones to make everything alot easier in the future.

3) Not just video games: Alot of the times people say that teens play too much video games, or are too much on social media. But there are other things a computer can do.
Programing, graphic design, so many things to learn which even have their own fields of study in university or college.
